"SNAPSHOT: patch-package fails when patch file is invalid

**ERROR** Failed to apply patch for package left-pad at path
  
    node_modules/left-pad

  This error was caused because patch-package cannot apply the following patch file:

    patches/left-pad+1.1.3.patch

  Try removing node_modules and trying again. If that doesn't work, maybe there was
  an accidental change made to the patch file? Try recreating it by manually
  editing the appropriate files and running:
  
    patch-package left-pad
  
  If that doesn't work, then it's a bug in patch-package, so please submit a bug
  report. Thanks!
