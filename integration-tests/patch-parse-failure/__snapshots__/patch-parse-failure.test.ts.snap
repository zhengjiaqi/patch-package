"SNAPSHOT: patch parse failure message

**ERROR** Failed to apply patch for package left-pad
    
  This happened because the patch file patches/left-pad+1.3.0.patch could not be parsed.
   
  If you just upgraded patch-package, you can try running:
  
    patch -p1 -i patches/left-pad+1.3.0.patch
    npx patch-package left-pad
    
  Otherwise, try manually creating the patch file again.
  
  If the problem persists, please submit a bug report:
  
    https://github.com/ds300/patch-package/issues/new?title=Patch+file+parse+error&body=%3CPlease+attach+the+patch+file+in+question%3E
